## SCRIPT

### Introduction (15 seconds)

"Hello everyone. Today I'm presenting our vocabulary analysis comparing English and Tamil using 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy. We chose this novel because it provides a substantial corpus of 560,000 words for meaningful analysis."

### Algorithm & Preprocessing (40 seconds)

*[Start screen recording, show notebook]*

"We used a frequency-based vocabulary construction algorithm, counting word occurrences to build our vocabulary. This method is interpretable and forms the foundation for techniques like TF-IDF. The same approach was applied to both languages."

*[Show Steps 3-4]*

"For English preprocessing, I applied four steps: tokenization using NLTK, normalization to lowercase with punctuation removal, stop-word removal, and lemmatization to convert words to base forms. My teammate did similar processing for Tamil, adapting for its morphological structure."

### Results (40 seconds)

*[Show vocabulary results]*

"The results: English vocabulary contains **14,949 unique words** with a Type-Token Ratio of 0.0831. Tamil has **860 unique words** with a higher TTR of 0.11."

*[Show visualizations]*

"Here are our visualizations showing the top words and frequency distributions. Both languages follow Zipf's Law - a few words appear very frequently while most appear rarely."

### Comparative Analysis (20 seconds)

*[Show comparison charts]*

"Tamil shows higher lexical diversity due to its agglutinative morphology. Words change form based on case, gender, and number, so one English word can map to multiple Tamil forms. This explains the vocabulary patterns we observe."

### Conclusion (5 seconds)

"This demonstrates how the same preprocessing pipeline reveals fundamental linguistic differences between languages. Thank you."

## KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE

- **Text:** War and Peace, 560,000 words
- **Algorithm:** Frequency-based vocabulary
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization → Normalization → Stopwords → Lemmatization
- **English:** 14,949 vocabulary, 0.0831 TTR
- **Tamil:** 860 vocabulary, 0.11 TTR
- **Key finding:** Tamil morphology creates higher lexical diversity
